  ## Description
 This project is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that leverages the Google Books API to enable users to search for books and manage their personal reading list. Users can browse and search for books without needing to log in. However, once they create an account and log in, they can save books to their personal list and remove them as they please.
